### get_ids.py

Start here. Gives a list of list in the form [game id, game, current bgg ranking]

Used to need pretty names, but with the game "prettified" in this loop, I'm envisioning that ```get_pretty_names.py``` can be deprecated and the game name in this list will be entered into the database.

### get_comments.py

This is next. This function updates the mongodb database with reviews and comments on games
